# Trie Map (Java Delight)

An implementation of the Trie Map data structure in Java - for efficient search for strings starting with a value.

This project is a fork of the [triemap](https://sourceforge.net/projects/triemap/) project by Marco Brade. Initially this version just removes the 
dependency to Apache Commons but future updates might include further changed.
